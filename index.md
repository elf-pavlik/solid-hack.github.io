# Solid March Mini-Hackathon 

Welcome, and thank you for participating in the Solid March Mini-Hackathon!

Interoperability is core to making Solid successful. We want to be sure that applications can work together, even if the developer teams aren't in communication.

That's why, for this March Hackathon, we will provide participants with a set [ShEx](https://shex.io) shapes. They are encouraged to use the shapes as a basis for their application.

## Register

[Register for the Hackathon Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJgFk2eH-U1UoeRFgtsRFDpRQhTFZdYhCFeirdtEZrpUNXnQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Registrations will remain open even after the hackathon has begun.

## Important Dates

 - __2024/03/18__: Hackathon officially begins
 - __2024/04/01__: Hacking period ends. Projects are accepted any time of day anywhere on Earth.

## Developer Tools

We encourage you to use one of the following developer tools. Each supports ShEx shapes.

 - [Linked Data Objects (LDO)](https://ldo.js.org) - A tool that lets developers manipulate Linked Data like typescript objects. ShEx is used to generate TypeScript. LDO works with any JavaScript framework, but has a special library for React. (__If you decide to use LDO, Jackson Morgan would also like to interview you on your experience, but participation in interviews is optional.__)

## ShEx Shapes

You may choose to use any ShEx shape they like, make modifications to shapes, or decide to build applications their own way. But, if you're looking for a place to get started, see the shapes below:

 - [Activity Pub](./shex/activity-pub.shex): Activity Pub is a general-use social media ontology used in popular platforms like Mastodon.
